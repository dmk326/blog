I am Devansh Mohan Kaushik. In this blog, I write mostly about C++ and Computer programming. I have been working in Software development since 2013, the majority of which has been in C++. Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Developer @ Adobe. C++ has never ceased to amaze me and, I have learned a great deal from it. I Intend to keep on learning more about this wonderful thing i.e. C++. My love for C++ is the main reason for starting this blog where I wish to share my knowledge and receive more from other like-minded people in the field of C++ and programming.
